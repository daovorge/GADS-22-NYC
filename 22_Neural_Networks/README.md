#Lesson 22 Neural Networks
###August 17th 2015

###Objectives for this class:
 * To define and illustrate a principal neural network architecture - the MLP or mulit-layered perceptron
 * To illustrate how a neural network can construct a non-linear decision boundary using the XOR problem
 * To define & investigate the backpropagation algorithm
 * To list other types of neural networks
