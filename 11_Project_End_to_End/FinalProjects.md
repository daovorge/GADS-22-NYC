## Stage 2: More details

* Full scope of data for project is acquired
* Clearly defined project goals, scope, questions, hypotheses and methods have been determined
* Presentation: Prediction/Classification presented to the class
* Well crafted ipython notebook explaining data

## Stage 3: Project Draft

* Github Wiki, Repository and/or Website Created

* Well crafted ipython notebook, or series of notebooks, with legible, commented code
* Ample, clear, prose introducing the topic, the problem, the hypotheses, the stakeholders and the potential impact

## Final Submissions and Presentations

## Background

The final project should represent your original work applying data science techniques to an interesting problem. Final projects are individual attainments, but you should definitely talk to your instructors and classmates about them.

Address a data-related problem in your professional field or in a field you're interested in. Pick a subject that you're passionate about; if you're strongly interested in the subject matter it'll be more fun for you and you'll probably produce a better project!

To stimulate your thinking, there is a [compendium](DataSources.md) of some public data sources. Using public data is the most common choice. If you have access to private data, that's also an option, though you'll have to be careful about what results you can release. Competing in a Kaggle competition is a project option as well.

The final project should include at least the following components:

 * Gather, preprocess and visualize one or more datasets. What can you learn from a high level analysis?
 * Apply appropriate techniques: regression/classification algorithms, evaluation, cross-validation, etc., and report your results.
 * Consider how you could implement what youâ€™ve done in a production system. Where would the data live? How would it represented? How would end users access it? What parts would be streaming vs. batch?

Optionally, it would be exciting to actually implement the system based on your work, and to the degree this is possible within the time frame of the course, it is certainly encouraged!

Before the end of the class, you will complete a github Wiki or repository (or a website!), with associated presentation, showcasing your project. The site should target a technical audience, but have general appeal

Your final project will include:

 * Description of problem and hypothesis.

 * Detailed description of your data set.
     * How did you decide what features to use in your analysis?
     * What challenges did you face in terms of obtaining and organizing the data?
     * What did you learn from the initial exploration phase?
 
* Description of the data science methods you used, and perhaps others you considered but did not use, and how you decided what to use.

* What business applications, if any, do your findings have?

* Describe the implementation plan in detail from the ingesting of data to how end users access it.

Your project should demonstrate a thorough understanding of data science techniques and the application of these in programming. It should communicate clearly to a reasonably technical audience.

In the final week of class you will give 2 presentations about your project. The first will be in the class environment and should be a 5-7 minute presentation summarizing your poject. This presentation should target a technical audience. 

At the last class you will present you project in a different environment. This presentation will, again, be about 5-7 minutes in length. This time, however, you should target a non-technical audience.

Both presentations are a chance to practice the highly sought-after communication skills that data scientists need.

For both presentations you will need an accompanying slide deck.

What to cover in your presentation:

 * Overview of problem and hypotheses
 * Overview of data
 * Appropriate visualizations
 * Modeling techniques used and why
 * Your findings, and how they're actionable
 * Your implementation plan, and any hurdles

Your presentation should be engaging, clear, and informative, describing the project, approach, and conclusions.

How do you know you're done?

 * You have a git repository accessible on github including all your project's data (if reasonably possible), source code, presentation slides, and final documentation.
 * You have given your final presentation with your class and instructors.
