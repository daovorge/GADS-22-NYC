#Lesson 6 Linear Models for Non-linear Problems
###June 12th 2015

###Objectives for this class:
 * To define non-linear features in the context of our current regression algorithms
 * To return to the concept of multivariate linear regression and look at non-linear multivariate regression
 * To list out the key Python commands for construction of non-linear features
 * To work through the iPython notebooks demonstrating the key python commands, and multivariate regression
 * To code along and develop an iPython notebook using the sklearn tools to implement multi-variate non-linear regression.
