#Lesson 10 Unsupervised Learning
###July 6th 2015

###Objectives for this class:
 * To define what is meant by unsupervised learning
 * To identify K-means as an important unsupervised learning algorithm
 * To list key aspects of K-means - how it works, what it does, advantages and disadvantages
 * To work through 2 iPython notebooks to demonstrate K-means
 * To code along and develop code to use K-means in visualizing the UN demographic data

### Term Project
  Answer the following questions:
  1. What is your topic? 
  2. Can you phrase your topic in the form of a question that you hope to answer?
  3. What do you plan to use as your source of data? 
  4. Do you have a sense for how large your dataset is? 
  5. Any other characteristics you know of?
  6. What tools or topics do you hope to learn and demonstrate by the end, or in other words, what are your learning objectives?


### Books
* Chris Bishop's book "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" is one of the definitive texts. It's heavy math & heavy Bayesian
* Machine Learning by Tom Mitchel also comes highly recommended (although I have not personally read this text)
* Cluster Analysis by Brian Everitt. Now up to the 5th edition, but is a good comprehensive look at all things to do with clustering

### Additional Resources
* [Visualizing K-Means Clustering](http://www.naftaliharris.com/blog/visualizing-k-means-clustering/)
* The sklearn documentation has some neat [examples](http://scikit-learn.org/dev/auto_examples/cluster/plot_cluster_comparison.html) demonstrating characteristics of various clustering algorithms.
* Check out the sklearn [text clustering example](http://scikit-learn.org/dev/auto_examples/text/document_clustering.html)
* Read Cloudera's post on [scaling k-means](http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2013/03/cloudera_ml_data_science_tools/)
* In-depth discussion of [Finding the K in K-Means Clustering](http://datasciencelab.wordpress.com/2013/12/27/finding-the-k-in-k-means-clustering/)
* [How to Engineer Features and How to Get Good at It](http://machinelearningmastery.com/discover-feature-engineering-how-to-engineer-features-and-how-to-get-good-at-it/)
* [About Feature Scaling and Normalization](http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_about_feature_scaling.html)
* Beaware of the linkedin Data Science group - plenty of blogs, discussion and job postings
* [Andrew Ng's coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/info), which is a great machine learning course. The notation I have used matches his. His course used Octave (like matlab), so unless you are dead keen to learn this, you can ignore the programming exercises. The course is a little mathematical at times, but overall he presents great videos about gradient descent, and linear models.
