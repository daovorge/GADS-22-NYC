#Lesson 8 Logistic Regression
###June 29th 2015

###Objectives for this class:
 * 
 * To work through an iPython notebook to illustrate under-fitting and over-fitting
 * To code along and develop an iPython notebook to find an optimal solution to the Africa Soil Ph problem using a brute force approach.

* [Andrew Ng's coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/info), which is a great machine learning course. The notation I have used matches his. His course used Octave (like matlab), so unless you are dead keen to learn this, you can ignore the programming exercises. The course is a little mathematical at times, but overall he presents great videos about gradient descent, and linear models.
