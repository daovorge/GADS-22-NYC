### Term Project
  Answer the following questions:
  1. What is your topic? 
  2. Can you phrase your topic in the form of a question that you hope to answer?
  3. What do you plan to use as your source of data? 
  4. Do you have a sense for how large your dataset is? 
  5. Any other characteristics you know of?
  6. What tools or topics do you hope to learn and demonstrate by the end, or in other words, what are your learning objectives?

#####Courses
[Andrew Ng's coursera course - week 7 on Large Margin Classification, Kernels, and SVMs in Practice](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/info). The notation I have used matches his. His course used Octave (like matlab), so unless you are dead keen to learn this, you can ignore the programming exercises.
