#####Meetups

#####Courses
[Andrew Ng's coursera course - week 9 on predicting movie ratings & collaborative filtering and Low Rank Matrix Factorization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/info). The notation I have used matches his. His course used Octave (like matlab), so unless you are dead keen to learn this, you can ignore the programming exercises.
