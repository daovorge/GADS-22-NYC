#Lesson 14 A/B Testing
###July 20th 2015

###Objectives for this class:
 * To define what is meant by dimensionality reduction
 * To identify Principal Components Analysis as an important algorithm
 * To list key aspects of PCA - how it works, what it does, advantages and disadvantages
 * To work through 2 iPython notebooks to demonstrate PCA, 1 for fundamental understanding and 1 for visualization
 * To work through a demo iPython notebook showcasing PCA with the IRIS dataset
 * To code along and develop code to use PCA in robust classification of the IRIS data using cross validation

### Term Project
  Answer the following questions:
  1. What is your topic? 
  2. Can you phrase your topic in the form of a question that you hope to answer?
  3. What do you plan to use as your source of data? 
  4. Do you have a sense for how large your dataset is? 
  5. Any other characteristics you know of?
  6. What tools or topics do you hope to learn and demonstrate by the end, or in other words, what are your learning objectives?

* Meetups
* [Andrew Ng's coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/info), which is a great machine learning course. The notation I have used matches his. His course used Octave (like matlab), so unless you are dead keen to learn this, you can ignore the programming exercises. The course is a little mathematical at times, but overall he presents great videos about gradient descent, and linear models.
