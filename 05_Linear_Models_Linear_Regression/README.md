#Lesson 4 Introduction to Linear Models and Gradient Descent
###June 15th 2015

###Objectives for this class:
 * To define what is meant by a linear model
 * To define the gradient descent alogorithm and it's relationship to optimizing linear models
 * To introduce the concept of feature scaling
 * To introduce the concept of learning algorithm hyper-parameters
 * To work through the iPython notebooks demonstrating gradient descent optimizing paramters for univariate linear regression
 * To code along and develop a short iPython notebook using the sklearn tools to implement gradient descent
