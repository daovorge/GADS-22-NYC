#Lesson 11 A Project: End-to-End
###July 8th 2015

###Objectives for this class:
 * To present to the class a completed data science project
 * To deliver the final presentation from the project
 * To identify 4 distinct parts of the project and work through a notebook on each
 * To assign class time to discuss the term project with class mates
 * To utilize class time to ask questions of the instructional staff about projects
 
###Class Agenda

  * Class to pause around 9.15pm for the Exit ticket
  * Wrap up
 
 
### Term Project
  Answer the following questions:
  1. What is your topic? 
  2. Can you phrase your topic in the form of a question that you hope to answer?
  3. What do you plan to use as your source of data? 
  4. Do you have a sense for how large your dataset is? 
  5. Any other characteristics you know of?
  6. What tools or topics do you hope to learn and demonstrate by the end, or in other words, what are your learning objectives?

* [Andrew Ng's coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/info), which is a great machine learning course. The notation I have used matches his. His course used Octave (like matlab), so unless you are dead keen to learn this, you can ignore the programming exercises. The course is a little mathematical at times, but overall he presents great videos about gradient descent, and linear models.
