#Lesson 16 Recommendation Systems
###July 27th 2015

###Objectives for this class:
 * To define the what is meant by a recommendation system
 * To identify and define the 2 types of recommendation systes - content & colloborative
 * To provide an example of content based recommendation
 * To identify and define the 2 types of colloborative filtering - nearest neighbors & matrix factorization
 * To provide examples of both kinds of collaborative filtering
 * To identify the pros and cons of the various types of recommendation systems

### Term Project
  Answer the following questions:
  1. What is your topic? 
  2. Can you phrase your topic in the form of a question that you hope to answer?
  3. What do you plan to use as your source of data? 
  4. Do you have a sense for how large your dataset is? 
  5. Any other characteristics you know of?
  6. What tools or topics do you hope to learn and demonstrate by the end, or in other words, what are your learning objectives?

#####Courses
[Andrew Ng's coursera course - week 9 on predicting movie ratings & collaborative filtering and Low Rank Matrix Factorization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/info), which is a great machine learning course. The notation I have used matches his. His course used Octave (like matlab), so unless you are dead keen to learn this, you can ignore the programming exercises. The course is a little mathematical at times, but overall he presents great videos about gradient descent, and linear models.
