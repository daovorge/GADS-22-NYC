#Lesson 8 Logistic Regression
###June 29th 2015

###Objectives for this class:
 * Determine why Linear Regression should not be used for classification problems
 * Explore the logistic function
 * Update the hypothesis function and define the decision boundary
 * Update the cost function
 * Define mulit-class logistic regression
 * To work through demonstration iPython notebooks that cover 2-dimensioinal 2-class problems, adding polynomial features to Logistic Regression models, and multi-class problems
 * To code along and develop an iPython notebook to model a small dataset taken from the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.

###Additional Resources
* [Explaining the confusion matrix](http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~dbd/cs831/notes/confusion_matrix/confusion_matrix.html)
* Nice example of classification with sklearn from [DataRobot](http://www.datarobot.com/blog/classification-with-scikit-learn/)
* [L1 norm vs L2 norm](http://www.chioka.in/differences-between-the-l1-norm-and-the-l2-norm-least-absolute-deviations-and-least-squares/)
* Beaware of the linkedin Data Science group - plenty of blogs, discussion and job postings
* [Data Science Central](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/) For discussions, conferences, jobs, etc
* [Andrew Ng's coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/info), which is a great machine learning course. The notation I have used matches his. His course used Octave (like matlab), so unless you are dead keen to learn this, you can ignore the programming exercises. The course is a little mathematical at times, but overall he presents great videos about gradient descent, and linear models.
