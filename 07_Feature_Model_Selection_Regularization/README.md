#Lesson 6 Linear Models for Non-linear Problems
###June 22th 2015

###Objectives for this class:
 * To define non-linear features in the context of our current regression algorithms
 * To return to the solution of multivariate linear regression and look at non-linear multivariate regression
 * To identify 2 key concepts in building linear models - Model Selection & Feature Selection
 * To define the need for validation with respect to Model Selection
 * To work through an iPython notebook to idenitfy and utilize the key commands for validation & non-linear MV regression
 * To work through an iPython notebook to illustrate multivariate non-linear regression
 * To code along and develop an iPython notebook using the sklearn tools to implement multi-variate non-linear regression.

* [Andrew Ng's coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/info), which is a great machine learning course. The notation I have used matches his. His course used Octave (like matlab), so unless you are dead keen to learn this, you can ignore the programming exercises. The course is a little mathematical at times, but overall he presents great videos about gradient descent, and linear models.
