#Lesson 5 Linear Models and Linear Regression
###June 17th 2015

###Objectives for this class:
 * To define the second algorithm that can be used to find the linear model parameters - the normal equations
 * To introduce the concept of multi-variate linear regression
 * To list out the assumptions of linear regression
 * To compare and contrast the normal equations with gradient descent
 * To work through the iPython notebooks demonstrating the normal equations and multi-variate linear regression
 * To code along and develop an iPython notebook using the sklearn tools to implement multi-variate linear regression.
