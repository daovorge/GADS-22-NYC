#Lesson 13 Naive Bayes
###July 15th 2015

###Objectives for this class:
 * To define the difference between a 'frequentist' and a 'Bayesian'
 * To illustrate and define Joint, Marginal and Conditional probabilities/distributions
 * To list and define the 2 rules of probability
 * To deduce and define Bayes' Theorem
 * To define Independence
 * To calculate, using the rules of probability and Bayes Theorem, the answers to the posed probability questions
 * To introduce and discuss Bayes Classifiers
 * To define a Naive Bayes' Classifiers, and precisely idenitfy the reason for the 'naive' tag
 * to define what a count vectorizer is and what an n-gram is

### Term Project
  Answer the following questions:
  1. What is your topic?

  3. What do you plan to use as your source of data? 
  4. Do you have a sense for how large your dataset is? 
  5. Any other characteristics you know of?
  6. What tools or topics do you hope to learn and demonstrate by the end, or in other words, what are your learning objectives?
