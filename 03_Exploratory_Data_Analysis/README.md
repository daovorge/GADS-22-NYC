#Lesson 3 Exploratory Data Analysis
###June 10th 2015

###Objectives for this class:

- To git pull without having local work over-written
- List actions that might be required to clean and pre-process data - aka exploratory data analysis
- Define the goal of EDA as being to produce a training set
- Undertake a code walk-through of an EDA of the IMdB database
- Relate the process of EDA to the larger goal of producing a term project
- Start the Essential Pandas Lab, and complete at home if necessary

###Get comfortable with the Operating System
- Command Line Interface (CLI) tools, organized around the `bash` shell.
- You can go as deep as you need to feel comfortable:
 * Installing the software. This is the bare minimum to have the tools available.
 * A gentle introduction. This is typically an in-browser interactive which assumes no prior knowledge.
 * A deeper dive. These provide much more exposition and extend to advanced topics.

##### Install
 * If you’re running Mac OS X, `bash` is what you have by default in `Terminal`. 
 * If you’re running Windows, you should [install Git Bash](http://openhatch.org/missions/windows-setup/install-git-bash).
 * If you’re running Linux, you run `bash` or know better

#### Gentle Introduction
 * If you haven’t used a command line interface like `bash`, try [The Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/). Ignore the stuff about PowerShell.
 * At the very least look at http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex2.html
